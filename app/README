PHP IMDb API
========

This is a php class for being able to use the IMDb api (not web scraping) 


## How it works

Decompiled the android app from IMDB to be how their API calls worked.
This class replicates these calls including appending the keys and looking like a regular android device querying.
To see this api at work, enable tot he $debug by setting it to TRUE
